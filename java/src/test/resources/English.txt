There have been some large, very peaceful protests in Baltimore since the death of Freddie Gray, attended by hundreds upset by what they perceive to be years of police discrimination and brutality.

But in many respects they have been overshadowed by more violent displays by small numbers of angry young protesters.

Over the weekend, as we watched young men hurling abuse, bottles and even spitting at police officers, we saw other demonstrators try to stop them and argue that only peaceful means would work.

But those confronting the police told us they felt the only way to stop officers killing black men was to "make the police pay" and to harm them.

They said the various gangs in the city would come together to make that happen until they saw a change, and felt they had got justice.
